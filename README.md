This project is a sampler plugin built in C++ using the JUCE framework, leveraging JUCE’s built-in basic sampler engine. It allows users to load and play back audio samples with expressive control over their dynamics and timbre.

🎛️ Key Features:

- Sample playback using JUCE’s basic sampler
- ADSR envelope with adjustable Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release
- LFO modulation targeting amplitude for dynamic movement
- Distortion toggle button to add harmonic character
- Final output volume control via a master gain slider
